140420 Update by Bumsoo Kim

* Added HOME pane. (Modified file: index.html, index.js)
   home-feed consists of the following
   * a page head
      this is directly copied off our previous version and the code is in index.html. Check yourself! The code is very ez.
      The only job done in index.js is turning the home pane on/off according to whether you go to home or other places.
   * 5 most recent selling/buying posts
      I used widgets for this (I think parth has documentations for widgets. It's essentially anything here. http://ashobiz.asia/metroking301/widgets1.html)
      I used the frame col-md-6 (so that there are two widgets horizontally.) See if the size makes sense!
   * 5 most recent selling/buying posts from each category of the user's preference.
      Widgets for this too.
   index.js became a LOT more complicated, but it essentially handles the case where HOME is clicked in a separate function. Nothing there is too difficult I think.
   
* Added coloring sidebar feature. (modified file: index.html, index.js)
   It keeps track of the current and future color using the url tracker (in index.js).

* Placed footer in appropriate position. (modified file: index.html, style.css)
   I removed the min-height: 1200 px in the "mainbar" section of style.css. This was what was creating the huge space in the bottom.
   What's needed: fancyboxes for About, Contact, FAQ. Probably conact will just be emailing us. Would ABOUT be a fancybox or on the main frame? What about FAQ?
   ICE takes us to a NEW PAGE (so click back to go back) here. I think it's not the BEST way, but it's reasonable and super easy to implement.
