Project Name: The Marketplace
Elevator Speech:
Where do you go if you want to buy a used Textbook or find an extra mattress for a visiting friend? If you're a Princeton student, a listserv like WhitmanWire or a Facebook post on the "Buy or Sell" group is one way, but you don’t read these anyway. Oh, there’s also the TigerTrade app -- except not many people know it exists. Unlike other successful TigerApps like ICE, TigerTrade suffers from a clunky User Interface, a lack of personalization and a non-existent user base. The Marketplace  will effectively replace TigerTrade for good.  Imagine having an online community of trusted buyer and sellers where you can ask for anything from a late meal delivery to a COS tutor and pay in whatever you're comfortable with. Imagine having a News Feed of postings that are highly tailored to your needs - your preference settings and your past activities allow us to deliver what matters to you the most. Imagine detailed postings of requests, sales, and purchases that anyone can accept conveniently. All this  is available in two clicks: just log on to The MarketPlace. It’s the most convenient way to buy, sell and exchange anything you want with anyone in Princeton.

This project will be using Google App Engine with Python and Django and CloudSQL.
